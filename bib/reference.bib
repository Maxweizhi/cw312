  abstract = {Autonomous robots are agents with physical bodies that share our 	environment. In this work, we test the hypothesis that physical embodiment has a measurable effect on performance and perception of social interactions. Support of this hypothesis would suggest fundamental differences between virtual agents and robots from a social standpoint and have significant implications for human-robot interaction. We measure task performance and perception of a robot's social abilities in a structured but open-ended task based on the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. Our experiment compares aspects of embodiment by evaluating: (1) the difference between a physical robot and a simulated one; (2) the effect of physical presence through a co-located robot versus a remote tele-present robot. We present data from a pilot study with 12 subjects showing interesting differences in perception of remote physical robot's and simulated agent's attention to the task, and task enjoyment.},

@article{tapus2008user,
  abstract = {This paper describes a hands-off socially assistive therapist robot designed to monitor, assist, encourage, and socially interact with post-stroke users engaged in rehabilitation exercises. We investigate the role of the robot’s personality in the hands-off therapy process, focusing on the relationship between the level of extroversion–introversion of the robot and the user. We also demonstrate a behavior adaptation system capable of adjusting its social interaction parameters (e.g., interaction distances/proxemics, speed, and vocal content) toward customized post-stroke rehabilitation therapy based on the user’s personality traits and task performance. Three validation experiment sets are described. The first maps the user’s extroversion–introversion personality dimension to a spectrum of robot therapy styles that range from challenging to nurturing. The second and the third experiments adjust the personality matching dynamically to adapt the robot’s therapy styles based on user personality and performance. The reported results provide first evidence for user preference for personality matching in the assistive domain and demonstrate how the socially assistive robot’s autonomous behavior adaptation to the user’s personality can result in improved human task performance.},

@article{wahimplementation,
  abstract = {This system is concerned with the design, sensing and intelligent control of robot that moves in synchronization with the movement of the natural eye. The system deals with a path planning and intelligent control of an autonomous robot which should move safely in partially structured environment. Signal processing techniques used in sensor are studied using statistical methods and artificial neural network based techniques. Multilayer neural networks have been successfully applied as intelligent sensors for process modeling and control. This environment may involve any number of obstacles of arbitrary shape and size; some of them are allowed to move. We describe our approach to solving the motion-planning problem in mobile robot control using neural networks-based technique. Artificial neural networks application builds intelligent soft sensors to estimate variables and detect and process data screening and analysis. Our method of the construction of a collision-free path for moving robot among obstacles is based on two neural networks. The first neural network is used to determine the “free” space using ultrasound range finder data. The second neural network “finds” a safe direction for the next robot section of the path in the workspace while avoiding the nearest obstacles. Simulation examples of generated path with proposed techniques will be presented. To show the potential of the proposed neural network based framework, the system is implemented by using MATLAB.},

@article{Eck2018Neural,
  abstract = {Neural networks are currently one of the most popular and fastest growing approaches to machine learning, driving advances in deep learning for difficult real-world applications ranging from image recognition to speech understanding in personal assistant agents to automatic language translation. Although not yet as commonly employed in survey research as other types of machine learning, neural networks offer natural extensions of well-known linear and logistic regression techniques in order to learn non-linear functions predicting or describing nearly any real-world process or problem (provided there are sufficient data and an appropriate set of parameters). Moreover, neural networks offer great potential towards more intelligent surveys in the future (e.g., adaptive design tailored to individual respondents’ characteristics and behavior, automated digital interviewers, analysis of rich multimedia data provided by respondents). Neural networks can learn for both regression and classification tasks without requiring assumptions about the underlying relationships between predictive variables and outcomes. In this article, we describe what neural networks are and how they learn (with tips for setting up a neural network), consider their strengths and weaknesses as a machine learning approach, and illustrate how they perform on a classification task predicting survey response from respondents’ (and nonrespondents’) prior known demographics.},

@article{jun2017comfort,
  abstract = {A body pressure based objective approach to evaluate human comfort/discomfort of seating devices is proposed and applied to a coccyx seating mat. Coccyx seating mats are to be used typically by decubitus or pressure ulcer (PU) patients and the desired features include alleviated interface pressure on the contact surface around the affected area, while maintaining well distributed body pressure which may give more comfort to its users. By introducing a pre-identification process to locate the easily identifiable ischial tuberosities, buttocks and coccyx related regions could be simply defined on the measured pressure maps. This two-step approach is applied to a coccyx mat to evaluate the objective comfort indices including the seat pressure distribution (SPD) and the mean pressure around coccyx under different seating conditions (a flat floor, an office chair, and a car seat) and the mat options. The test results support that the proposed cushion mat effectively alleviates pressure near coccyx maintaining less overall body pressure over the mat.},

@article{ballard2021machine,
  abstract = {Over the past several decades the dramatic increase in the availability of computational resources, coupled with the maturation of machine learning, has profoundly impacted sensor technology. In this Perspective, we discuss computational sensing with a focus on intelligent sensor system design. By leveraging inverse design and machine learning techniques, data acquisition hardware can be fundamentally redesigned to ‘lock-in’ to the optimal sensing data with respect to a user-defined cost function or design constraint. We envision a new generation of computational sensing systems that reduce the data burden while also improving sensing capabilities, enabling low-cost and compact sensor implementations engineered through iterative analysis of data-driven sensing outcomes. We believe that the methodologies discussed in this Perspective will permeate the design phase of sensing hardware, and thereby will fundamentally change and challenge traditional, intuition-driven sensor and readout designs in favour of application-targeted and perhaps highly non-intuitive implementations. Such computational sensors enabled by machine learning can therefore foster new and widely distributed applications that will benefit from ‘big data’ analytics and the internet of things to create powerful sensing networks, impacting various fields, including for example, biomedical diagnostics, environmental sensing and global health, among others.},
