        "abstract": "This paper describes an autonomous assistive mobile robot that aids stroke patient rehabilitation by providing monitoring, encouragement, and reminders. The robot navigates autonomously, monitors the patient's arm activity, and helps the patient remember to follow a rehabilitation program. Our experiments show that patients post-stroke are positive about this approach and that increasingly active and animated robot behavior is positively received by stroke survivors.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robots are agents with physical bodies that share our \tenvironment. In this work, we test the hypothesis that physical embodiment has a measurable effect on performance and perception of social interactions. Support of this hypothesis would suggest fundamental differences between virtual agents and robots from a social standpoint and have significant implications for human-robot interaction. We measure task performance and perception of a robot's social abilities in a structured but open-ended task based on the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. Our experiment compares aspects of embodiment by evaluating: (1) the difference between a physical robot and a simulated one; (2) the effect of physical presence through a co-located robot versus a remote tele-present robot. We present data from a pilot study with 12 subjects showing interesting differences in perception of remote physical robot's and simulated agent's attention to the task, and task enjoyment.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has huge potential to transform healthcare. However, significant expertise is required to train such models and this is a significant blocker for their translation into clinical practice. In this study, we therefore sought to evaluate the use of automated deep learning software to develop medical image diagnostic classifiers by healthcare professionals with limited coding {\\textendash} and no deep learning {\\textendash} expertise.We used five publicly available open-source datasets: (i) retinal fundus images (MESSIDOR); (ii) optical coherence tomography (OCT) images (Guangzhou Medical University/Shiley Eye Institute, Version 3); (iii) images of skin lesions (Human against Machine (HAM)10000) and (iv) both paediatric and adult chest X-ray (CXR) images (Guangzhou Medical University/Shiley Eye Institute, Version 3 and the National Institute of Health (NIH)14 dataset respectively) to separately feed into a neural architecture search framework that automatically developed a deep learning architecture to classify common diseases. Sensitivity (recall), specificity and positive predictive value (precision) were used to evaluate the diagnostic properties of the models. The discriminative performance was assessed using the area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). In the case of the deep learning model developed on a subset of the HAM10000 dataset, we performed external validation using the Edinburgh Dermofit Library dataset.Diagnostic properties and discriminative performance from internal validations were high in the binary classification tasks (range: sensitivity of 73.3-97.0\\%, specificity of 67-100\\% and AUPRC of 0.87-1). In the multiple classification tasks, the diagnostic properties ranged from 38-100\\% for sensitivity and 67-100\\% for specificity. The discriminative performance in terms of AUPRC ranged from 0.57 to 1 in the five automated deep learning models. In an external validation using the Edinburgh Dermofit Library dataset, the automated deep learning model showed an AUPRC of 0.47, with a sensitivity of 49\\% and a positive predictive value of 52\\%. The quality of the open-access datasets used in this study (including the lack of information about patient flow and demographics) and the absence of measurement for precision, such as confidence intervals, constituted the major limitation of this study.All models, except for the automated deep learning model trained on the multi-label classification task of the NIH CXR14 dataset, showed comparable discriminative performance and diagnostic properties to state-of-the-art performing deep learning algorithms. The performance in the external validation study was low. The availability of automated deep learning may become a cornerstone for the democratization of sophisticated algorithmic modelling in healthcare as it allows the derivation of classification models without requiring a deep understanding of the mathematical, statistical and programming principles. Future studies should compare several application programming interfaces on thoroughly curated datasets.",

        "abstract": "Over the past several decades the dramatic increase in the availability of computational resources, coupled with the maturation of machine learning, has profoundly impacted sensor technology. In this Perspective, we discuss computational sensing with a focus on intelligent sensor system design. By leveraging inverse design and machine learning techniques, data acquisition hardware can be fundamentally redesigned to \u2018lock-in\u2019 to the optimal sensing data with respect to a user-defined cost function or design constraint. We envision a new generation of computational sensing systems that reduce the data burden while also improving sensing capabilities, enabling low-cost and compact sensor implementations engineered through iterative analysis of data-driven sensing outcomes. We believe that the methodologies discussed in this Perspective will permeate the design phase of sensing hardware, and thereby will fundamentally change and challenge traditional, intuition-driven sensor and readout designs in favour of application-targeted and perhaps highly non-intuitive implementations. Such computational sensors enabled by machine learning can therefore foster new and widely distributed applications that will benefit from \u2018big data\u2019 analytics and the internet of things to create powerful sensing networks, impacting various fields, including for example, biomedical diagnostics, environmental sensing and global health, among others.",

        "abstract": "Domain shift refers to the well known problem that a model trained in one source domain performs poorly when appliedto a target domain with different statistics. Domain Generalization (DG) techniques attempt to alleviate this issue by producing models which by design generalize well to novel testing domains. We propose a novel meta-learning method for domain generalization. Rather than designing a specific model that is robust to domain shift as in most previous DG work, we propose a model agnostic training procedure for DG. Our algorithm simulates train/test domain shift during training by synthesizing virtual testing domains within each mini-batch. The meta-optimization objective requires that steps to improve training domain performance should also improve testing domain performance. This meta-learning procedure trains models with good generalization ability to novel domains. We evaluate our method and achieve state of the art results on a recent cross-domain image classification benchmark, as well demonstrating its potential on two classic reinforcement learning tasks.",

Here we present the MuZero algorithm, which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics.

We also demonstrate a behavior adaptation system capable of adjusting its social interaction parameters (e.g., interaction distances/proxemics, speed, and vocal content) toward customized post-stroke rehabilitation therapy based on the user\u2019s personality traits and task performance. Three validation experiment sets are described. The first maps the user\u2019s extroversion\u2013introversion personality dimension to a spectrum of robot therapy styles that range from challenging to nurturing. The second and the third experiments adjust the personality matching dynamically to adapt the robot\u2019s therapy styles based on user personality and performance. The reported results provide first evidence for user preference for personality matching in the assistive domain and demonstrate how the socially assistive robot\u2019s autonomous behavior adaptation to the user\u2019s personality can result in improved human task performance.",
